# E-Auction Application Frontend Setup Guide

Before proceeding with the installation instructions, please note that the required frontend components are located in the e-auction/ folder.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the frontend for your React application, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Node.js and npm:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies and run scripts. You can download and install them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the React application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the e-auction/ folder using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/e-auction/
3. Install project dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Once the installation is complete, start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
5. The React application will be hosted locally, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/ by default.

That's it! Your E-Auction frontend should now be up and running locally.
